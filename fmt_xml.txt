# Ensure that your XML file is properly formatted by checking the tags, closures, and overall structure.
# Compress the XML file to facilitate its direct transmission to the message queue (MQ).
# Additionally, maintain a version of the file in a well-formatted, readable style.
# **Why should you use this approach?**
# You can easily edit your XML file without worrying about its formatting. After
# making your changes, run this script to convert your file into a neatly
# formatted version and prepare it for direct sending to the MQ.
