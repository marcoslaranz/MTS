# ✅ Pre-Session Checklist  
**for MTS Training with Marcos**

To make the most of your session, here are a few things to bring or think through:

---

## 🔧 Setup

- [ ] Are you working in a **live**, **test**, or **simulated** MTS environment?  
- [ ] Do you have access to relevant configuration files (e.g., `route.cfg`, `settings.cfg`)?

---

## 📂 Files You Might Want Handy

- [ ] A sample **error log** or recent incident  
- [ ] Your current **pakman installation manifest**  
- [ ] Any custom rule setups or processing chains you’re struggling with  
- [ ] Notes from a previous implementation (optional but helpful)

---

## ❓ What You'd Like to Learn

- [ ] List 1–3 specific questions or areas of uncertainty  
- [ ] Are you trying to **debug**, **learn**, or **optimize**?

---

## 🌐 Session Logistics

- [ ] We’ll meet via Zoom/Teams/Meet (your preference)  
- [ ] Feel free to screen-share and ask freely — this is collaborative  
- [ ] Recording is optional — just ask before we begin

---

Looking forward to working together!
